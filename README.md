# AMinerOpen

[AMinerOpen](http://open.aminer.cn/) is an open source community who focuses on developing and publishing elegant algorithms, models and tools for science big data mining and knowledge intelligence with [AMiner](https://www.aminer.cn) resources.

This is not a code repo because most functions need **large files** which are not convenient for uploading. Therefore, we focus on providing APIs.

And this repo is on construction...

# Planned APIs

## Word Embeddings

[[repo]](https://github.com/AMinerOpen/AWOE)

* Chinese and English pre-trained word embeddings based on 2 billion publication titles and abstracts
* Chinese and English pre-trained key word embeddings based on 2 billion publication key words
* Cross-lingual academic word (or key word) embeddings (Chinese-English)

## NSFC Related


* Text classifier of NSFC disciplines [[repo]](https://github.com/AMinerOpen/prediction_api)
* Academic key words extraction (or recommendation) from raw text

## Information Extraction

* Given a researcher's name, extract structured information from web

# Citation

If our APIs help you in some way, please consider cite the following publication(s):

* Jie Tang, Jing Zhang, Limin Yao, Juanzi Li, Li Zhang, and Zhong Su. ArnetMiner: Extraction and Mining of Academic Social Networks. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (SIGKDDâ€™2008).
